**The** c++ package manager.

## Quick introduction to vcpkg

vcpkg is a package manager for C++ libraries on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
It provides a simple command-line interface for installing and managing C++ libraries, with features such as dependency resolution, version management, and integration with build systems like CMake.

Using vcpkg can make it easier to manage dependencies in your C++ projects, especially if you are working on multiple platforms or with many libraries.
It can help you avoid issues with library compatibility and version mismatches, as well as save time by automating the installation and management of libraries.

Additionally, vcpkg provides a large catalog of C++ libraries that you can easily search and install, which can save you the trouble of manually downloading and building each library yourself.
